# TDS-VIRTUAL-TA

This project is part of the TDS  coursework and aims to build a Virtual Teaching Assistant (TA) using Python.

## Overview

The Virtual TA helps in answering student queries using pre-defined knowledge stored in a database. It uses:

- A Python backend (`app.py`)
- A lightweight knowledge base (`knowledge_base.db`)
- Custom preprocessing (ignored in the repo)
- Deployment-ready config (`vercel.json`)
